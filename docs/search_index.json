A.1 Quiz 1—R Preliminaries (Updated for 2018) Grading policies for the course Course requirements / policies for in-class quizzes Open source software “free as in beer” versus “free as in speech” Difference between R and RStudio R packages CRAN Installing packages install.packages() Loading a package library() package::function() notation Types of package documentation: vignettes and helpfiles vignette(), option package = Accessing a function’s helpfile using ? R objects and object names “gets arrow”: &lt;- = vs. &lt;- for object assignment Rules and style guidelines for naming objects Tab completion ls() Vectors c() Two of the basic classes of vectors: character and numeric class() Square bracket indexing for vectors: [...] Dataframes data_frame() Square bracket indexing for dataframes: [..., ...] read_csv, option skip = str() summary() dim() ncol() nrow() Nate Silver FiveThirtyEight R session R scripts Working at the console versus working from an R script # comment character NA for missing values $ to get a column from a dataframe paste(), option sep = paste0() A.2 Quiz 2—Entering / cleaning data #1 (Updated for 2018) What kinds of data can be read into R? delimited files (csv, tsv) fixed width files delimiter read_delim, options delim =, skip =, n_max =, col_names = read_fwf read_csv, options skip =, n_max =, col_names = readxl package and its read_excel() function haven package and its read_sas() function NA Computer directory structure working directory getwd() list.files() relative pathnames absolute pathnames shorthand for pathnames: ., .., ../data, etc. Reading in data from either a local or online flat file paste(), option sep = paste0() How to read flat files of data that are online directly into R dplyr package rename() Why you might want to rename column names (e.g., uppercase, long, unusual characters) select() slice() mutate() filter() arrange(), including with desc() Main types of vector classes in R: character, numeric, factor, date, logical lubridate functions, include ymd, ymd_hm, mdy, wday, and mday %&gt;%, advantages of piping Common logical operators in R (==, !=, %in%, is.na(), &amp;, |) A.3 Quiz 3 (Updated for 2018) data() (with and without the name of a dataset as an option) library() (with and without an argument in the parentheses) logical vectors, including running sum on a logical vector What the bang operator (!) does to a logical operator The tidyverse range() min() max() mean() median() table() cor(), both for two variables in a dataframe, and to get the correlation matrix for several variables in a dataframe summary(), as applied to: different classes of vectors (numeric, factor, logical) and dataframes What to do if you want to apply a summary statistic function to a vector with missing values (you do not need to know every option name for all the functions, just know that you would need to include an option like na.rm= or use=, and that you can use the help file for a function to figure out the option call for that function). The following about object-oriented programming: In R, it means that some functions, like summary(), will do different things depending on what type of object you call it on. summarize() Special functions to use with summarize(): n(), n_distinct(), first(), last() Using group_by() before using summarize() The three basic elements of a ggplot plot: data, aesthetics, and geoms aes function and common aesthetics, including color, shape, x, y, alpha, size, and fill Mapping an aesthetic to a column in the data versus setting it to a constant value Some common geoms: geom_histogram, geom_points, geom_lines, geom_boxplot() The difference between “statistical” geoms (e.g., geom_boxplot, geom_smooth) and “non-statistical” (e.g., geom_point, geom_line) Common additions to ggplot objects: ggtitle, labs, xlim, ylim, expand_limits A.4 Quiz 4 (Updated for 2018) Guidelines for good graphics Data density / data-to-ink ratio Small multiples Edward Tufte Hadley Wickham Where to put the + in ggplot statements to avoid problems (ends of lines instead of starts of new lines) Can you save a ggplot object as an R object that you can reference later? If so, how would you add elements on to that object? How would you print it when you were ready to print the graph to your RStudio graphics window? geom_hline(), geom_vline() geom_text() facet_grid(), facet_wrap() grid.arrange() from the gridExtra package ggthemes package, including theme_few() and theme_tufte() Setting point color for geom_point() both as a constant (all points red) and as a way to show the level of a factor for each observation size, alpha, color Re-naming and re-ordering factors Note: If you read this and find and bring in an example of a “small multiples” graph (from a newspaper, a website, an academic paper), you can get one extra point on this quiz A.5 Quiz 5 (Updated for 2018; no updates since last week) Reproducible research, including what it is and advantages to aiming to make your research reproducible R style guidelines on variable names, &lt;- vs. =, line length, spacing, semicolons, commenting, indentation, and code grouping Markup languages (concept and examples) Basic conventions for Markdown (bold, italics, links, headers, lists) Literate programming What working directory R uses for code in an .Rmd document Basic syntax for RMarkdown chunks, including how to name them Options for RMarkdown chunks: echo, eval, messages, warnings, include, fig.width, fig.height, results Difference between global options and chunk options, and which takes precendence What inline code is and how to write it in RMarkdown How to set global options Why style is important in coding RPubs A.6 Quiz 6 Three characteristics of tidy data Five common problems with tidy data and how to resolve them (make sure you understand the examples shown, which you can find out more about in the Hadley Wickham paper I reference in the slides) group_by with mutate, slice, and arrange lag and lead with mutate separate and unite gather and spread The *_join family of functions (left_join, right_join, inner_join, full_join, anti_join, semi_join) A.7 Quiz 7 lists indexing from lists ([[ and $) exploring lists (class, names, str functions) Regression modeling with lm, glm Writing a formula with ~ syntax Using functions from broom to tidy model output (augment, tidy, glance) autoplot kable() from the knitr package How many objects a function can input. How many objects a function can output. if / else if / else structures inside functions Idea of error checking (e.g., with assertive package) A.8 Quiz 8 Regular expressions (the concept and which package you would use) nest and unnest (from purrr package) map family of functions basics of writing a function Mapping using ggplot2 framework with dataframes of geographical data (in the slides, “Point maps”) Choropleths, choroplethr map_data get_map ggmap "]
