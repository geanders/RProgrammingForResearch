# Function calls

## Function calls

In general, function calls in R take the following structure: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Generic code (this won't run)
function_name(formal_argument_1 = named_argument_1, 
              formal_argument_2 = named_argument_2,
              [etc.])
```

A function call forms a complete R expression, and the output will 
be the result of running `print` or `show` on the object that is output
by the function call.

## Function calls

Here is an example of this structure: 

```{r}
print(x = "Hello world")
```

## Function calls

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "325pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/function_call.jpg")
```

In this example, we're **calling** a function with the **name** `print`. It has one
**argument**, with a **formal argument** of `x`, which in this call we've provided
the **named argument** "Hello world". 

## Function calls

The **arguments** are how you customize the call to an R function. 

For example, you can use change the named argument value to print different messages 
with the `print` function: 

```{r}
print(x = "Hello world")
print(x = "Hi Fort Collins")
```

## Function calls

Some functions do not require any arguments. For example, the `getRversion` function will 
print out the version of R you are using.

```{r}
getRversion()
```

## Function calls

Some functions will accept multiple arguments. For example, the `print` function allows you 
to specify whether the output should include quotation marks, using the `quote`
formal argument: 

```{r}
print(x = "Hello world", quote = TRUE)
print(x = "Hello world", quote = FALSE)
```

## Function calls

Arguments can be **required** or **optional**. 

For a required argument, if you don't provide a value for the argument when you
call the function, R will respond with an error. For example, `x` is a **required argument**
for the `print` function, so if you try to call the function without it, you'll get an 
error: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
print()
```

```
Error in print.default() : argument "x" is 
  missing, with no default
```

## Function calls

For an **optional argument** on the other hand, R knows a **default value** for that 
argument, so if you don't give it a value for that argument, it will just use the 
default value for that argument. 

For example, for the `print` function, the `quote` argument has the default value 
`TRUE`. So if you don't specify a value for that argument, R will assume it should 
use `quote = TRUE`. That's why the following two calls give the same result: 

```{r}
print(x = "Hello world", quote = TRUE)
print(x = "Hello world")
```

## Function helpfiles

Often, you'll want to find out more about a function, including:

- Examples of how to use the function
- Which arguments you can include for the function
- Which  arguments are required versus optional
- What the default values are for optional arguments. 

You can find out all this information in the function's **helpfile**, which 
you can access using the function `?`. 

## Function helpfiles

For example, the `mean` function will let you calculate the mean (average) of a 
group of numbers. To find out more about this function, at the console type:

```{r eval = FALSE}
?mean
```

This will open a helpfile in the "Help" pane in RStudio.

## Function helpfiles

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "300pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/helpfile.jpg")
```

The helpfile includes sections giving the function's **usage**, **arguments**,
**value**, and **examples**.

## Function helpfiles

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "250pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/helpfile_arguments.jpg")
```

You can figure out which arguments are **required** and which are
**optional** in the Usage section of the helpfile.

## Operators

There's one class of functions that looks a bit different from others. These are the 
infix **operator** functions. 

Instead using parentheses after the function name, they usually go *between* two 
arguments. 

One common example is the `+` operator: 

```{r}
2 + 3
```

## Operators

There are operators for several mathematical functions: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

There are also other operators, including **logical operators** and 
**assignment operators**, which we'll cover later.
