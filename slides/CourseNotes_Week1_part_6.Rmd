# More on talking to R

## "Composing" to combine function calls

What if you want to "compose" a call from more than one function call?

One way to do it is to assign the output from the first function call to a name and
then use that name for the next call. 

For example: 

```{r}
message <- paste("Hello", "world")
print(x = message)
```

## "Composing" to combine function calls

You can also "nest" one function call inside another function call. For example:

```{r}
print(x = paste("Hello", "world"))
```

Just like with math, the order that the functions are evaluated moves from the
inner set of parentheses to the outer one.

There's one more way we'll look at later...

## Using R scripts

The console can be great for quick functions to explore the data. 

However, for most data analysis work you'll want to use a script, so you can
save all the expressions you used for the analysis.

This improves the *reproducibility* of your analysis.

## R scripts

An **R script** is a plain text file where you can write down and save R code. 

When you write, run, and save your R code in a script rather than running it one
line at a time in the console, you can easily go back and re-do exactly what you
did again later. 

You can also share the script for someone else to use, or run it on a different
computer.

## R scripts

RStudio has one pane that shows any R scripts you have open. If you'd like to
create new R scripts, you can do that in RStudio with the following steps:

- Open a new script file in RStudio: `File` -> `New File` -> `R Script`.
- I recommend that you make an "R" folder in all of the R project directories
that you create and save all your script files in that folder.
- Save scripts using the extension `.R`

## R scripts

Running code in R scripts line-by-line:

- To run code from an R script file in RStudio, you can use the `Run` button (or
`Command-R`).
- This will run whatever's on your cursor line or whatever's highlighted.

**Sourcing** an R script (i.e., running all the code saved in the script):

- To run the whole script, you can also use the `source` function with the
filename.
- You can also use the "Source" button on the script pane. 

## R scripts

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width= "300pt"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/ExampleOfRScript.jpg")
```

## Comment characters

Sometimes, you'll want to include notes in your code. You can do this in all
programming languages by using a **comment character** to start the line with
your comment.

In R, the comment character is the hash symbol, `#`. R will skip any line that
starts with `#` in a script.

```{r}
# Don't print this.
"But print this"
```

## Closing an R session

Do **not** save the history of your R session when you close RStudio. Instead,
get in the habit of writing your R code in reproducible formats (R scripts,
RMarkdown documents)
