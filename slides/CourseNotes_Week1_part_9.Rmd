# Dataframes

## Structure of dataframe objects

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "300pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/example_dataframe.jpg")
```

A **dataframe** combines one or more vectors of the same length stuck together
side-by-side. 

## Structure of dataframe objects

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "325pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/example_dataframe_labeled.jpg")
```

A dataframe contains **rows** and **columns**, and each column has a 
**column name**.

## Creating dataframes

We'll be working with a specific class of dataframe called a **tibble**.

You can create tibble dataframe using the `tibble` function from the `tibble`
package. 

However, most often you will create a dataframe by reading in data from
a file---most datasets
will not be short enough that you want to enter them by hand in R.

We'll look at both methods of creating dataframes.

## Creating dataframes

The format for creating a tibble dataframe using the `tibble` function is:

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Generic code
library(package = "tibble")
[name of object] <- tibble([1st column name] = 
                                     [1st column content],
                           [2nd column name] = 
                                     [2nd column content],
                           etc.)
```

## Creating dataframes

```{r}
library(package = "tibble")
hp_data <- tibble(first_name = c("Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"),
                  last_name = c("Potter", "Weasley", "Granger"),
                  n_kids = c(1, 7, 1),
                  survived = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE))
hp_data
```

## Creating dataframes

You can also create dataframes by joining together vector objects you previously
created, as long as they have the same length and line up:

```{r}
main_characters <- c("Harry", "Ron", "Hermione")
n_kids <- c(1, 7, 1)
hp_data <- tibble(first_name = main_characters,
                  last_name = c("Potter", "Weasley", "Granger"),
                  n_kids = n_kids,
                  survived = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE))
hp_data
```

## Creating dataframes

Usually, instead of creating a dataframe from vectors, you'll read one in from
data on an outside file, for example using `read_csv` from the `readr` package.

\medskip

For example, to read in a dataset from a csv file called "daily_show_guests.csv":

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(package = "readr")
daily_show <- read_csv(file = "../data/daily_show_guests.csv",
                       skip = 4)
```
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(package = "readr")
daily_show <- read_csv(file = "daily_show_guests.csv",
                       skip = 4)
```

## Creating dataframes

This has read data in from the external file into a dataframe object in my R
session:

```{r}
ls()
```

## Dataframes

You can use the functions `dim`, `nrow`, and `ncol` to figure out the dimensions
(number of rows and columns) of a dataframe:

```{r}
dim(x = daily_show)
nrow(x = daily_show)
ncol(x = daily_show)
```

## Dataframes

Base R also has some useful functions for quickly exploring dataframes:

- `str`: Show the structure of an R object, including a dataframe
- `summary`: Give summaries of each column of a dataframe.


## Extracting values from dataframes

The `dplyr` package has two functions for extracting data from dataframes by position: 
`slice` to extract rows based on their row position and select to extract columns
based on their column position.

## Extracting values from dataframes

For example, if you wanted to get the first two rows of the `hp_data`
dataframe, you could run:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(package = "dplyr")
slice(.data = hp_data, c(1:2))
```

## Extracting values from dataframes

If you wanted to get the first and fourth columns, you could run: 

```{r}
select(.data = hp_data, c(1, 4))
```

## Extracting values from dataframes

You can compose calls from both functions. For example, you could extract the
values in the first and fourth columns of the first two rows with: 

```{r}
select(slice(.data = hp_data, c(1:2)), c(1, 4))
```



<!-- ## Dataframes -->

<!-- You can use indexing (`[..., ...]`) for dataframes, too, but now they'll have -->
<!-- two dimensions (rows, then columns). For example: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- hp_data[1:2, 2] # First two rows, second column -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Dataframes -->

<!-- If you want all of something, leave the designated spot blank. For example: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- hp_data[3, ] # Last row, all columns -->
<!-- ``` -->
