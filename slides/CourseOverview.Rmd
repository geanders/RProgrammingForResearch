you have limited space on your laptop.

## Content

We will cover four large themes in this course:

- Entering and cleaning data
- Exploring data
- Reporting data results
- Reproducible research

## Content

The first week covers preliminaries, and after that there will be "cycles" of covering these topics:

- **Preliminaries** Week 1
- **Basic** Weeks 2--5 (ERHS 581A3 ends here)
- **Intermediate** Weeks 6--9
- **Advanced** Weeks 10--15
- **Final** Week 16

A detailed course schedule is available in the online course book.

## Grading---ERHS 535

If you are taking ERHS 535, your grade will be determined based on the following components:

```{r echo = FALSE}
a <- data.frame(a = c("Final group project",
                      "Weekly in-class quizzes, weeks 2--10",
                      "Homeworks 1--6",
                      "Attendance and class participation",
                      "Weekly in-course group exercises"),
                b = c(30, 25, 25, 10, 10))
knitr::kable(a, col.names = c("Assessment component", 
                              "Percent of grade"))
```

## Grading---ERHS 581A3

If you are taking ERHS 581A3, your grade will be determined based on the following components:

```{r echo = FALSE}
a <- data.frame(a = c("Weekly in-class quizzes, weeks 2--5",
                      "Homeworks 1 and 2",
                      "Attendance and class participation",
                      "Weekly in-course group exercises"),
                b = c(40, 30, 10, 20))
knitr::kable(a, col.names = c("Assessment component", 
                              "Percent of grade"))
```

## Attendance and class participation

You will meet twice each week in a live session. 

On Wednesdays, there will be two "cohorts" for these meetings. Half of the students will meet
live each week from **10:00 AM--10:55 AM on Mondays and Wednesdays**. The 
other half of the class will meet live each week 
**11:00 AM--11:55 AM on Mondays and Wednesdays**. 

I will be sending out a poll to help determine which Wednesday cohort works best for each student (starting next week).

## Attendance and class participation---ERHS 535

Because so much of the learning for this class is through interactive work in
class, it is critical that you come to class.

On days that you have a quiz, the quiz will also be used to assess attendance. 
On other days, you will fill out an "Exit Ticket" when you leave the class. 

Lectures will be shared through YouTube. They are embedded in the online 
course book within each chapter. At the start of each chapter, you can also 
find a link to a YouTube playlist with all videos for the chapter.

knitr::include_graphics("../figures/playlist_2.png")
```

## Attendance and class participation

You will be responsible for watching 
certain videos *before* you attend each live session. You will receive
an email reminder with the list of videos you need to watch before each meeting.
There will be about two hours worth of video lectures each week, broken into 
videos about 10--15 minutes each.

This week, you will be responsible for watching the first nine videos
in Chapter 1 ("R Preliminaries"). 

## Attendance and class participation---ERHS 581A3

If you are in **ERHS 535**, out of a possible 10 points for class attendance,
you will get:

- **10 points** if you miss two or fewer classes
- **8 points** if you miss three classes
- **6 points** if you miss four classes
- **4 points** if you miss five classes
- **2 points** if you miss six classes
- **0 points** if you miss seven or more classes

## Attendance and class participation---ERHS 581A3

If you are in **ERHS 581A3**, out of a possible 10 points for class attendance,
you will get:

- **10 points** if you miss one or fewer classes
- **8 points** if you miss two classes
- **6 points** if you miss three classes
- **4 points** if you miss four classes
- **2 points** if you miss five classes
- **0 points** if you miss six or more classes

## Attendance and class participation

Excused absences: 

- Attendance this week will not be counted
- CSU-related: This is typically missing to attend a conference or for a field
study for your research. To be excused, this requires a letter/email from your
adviser.
- Serious medical issue.
- For an absence to be excused, you must email me a copy of the letter (if required) by 5:00
pm the Friday afternoon following the class you missed.

## Weekly in-course group exercises

- As long as you are in class and participate in these exercises, you will get
full credit for this component.
- **If you miss a class,** to get credit towards this component of your grade, you
will need to turn in a few paragraphs describing what was covered in the
exercise and what you learned.
- To get credit for this, you must submit it to me by email by 5:00 pm the Friday
afternoon of the week of the class you missed.
- All in-class exercises are included in the online course book at the end of
the chapter on the associated material.

## Homework

- In approximately the first five weeks, there will be two homework assignments (see detailed
schedule in the online course book).
- The first should be done individually. 
- Homeworks will be graded for correctness, but some partial credit will be
given for questions you try but fail to answer correctly. Some of the exercises will 
not have "correct" answers, but instead will be graded on completeness.

## Homework 

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "300pt", echo = FALSE}

```

## Homework

- Homework is due to me by email by midnight on the due date. 
- Your grade will be reduced by 10 points for each day it is late, and will
receive no credit if it is late by over a week.
