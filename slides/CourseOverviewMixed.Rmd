## Grading---ERHS 535

If you are taking ERHS 535, your grade will be determined based on the following components:

```{r echo = FALSE}
a <- data.frame(a = c("Final group project",
                      "Weekly in-class quizzes, weeks 2--10",
                      "Homeworks 1--6",
                      "Attendance and class participation",
                      "Weekly in-course group exercises"),
                b = c(30, 25, 25, 10, 10))
knitr::kable(a, col.names = c("Assessment component", 
                              "Percent of grade"))
```

<!-- ## Grading---ERHS 581A3 -->

<!-- If you are taking ERHS 581A3, your grade will be determined based on the following components: -->

<!-- ```{r echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- a <- data.frame(a = c("Weekly in-class quizzes, weeks 2--5", -->
<!--                       "Homeworks 1 and 2", -->
<!--                       "Attendance and class participation", -->
<!--                       "Weekly in-course group exercises"), -->
<!--                 b = c(40, 30, 10, 20)) -->
<!-- knitr::kable(a, col.names = c("Assessment component",  -->
<!--                               "Percent of grade")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Attendance and class participation

You will meet twice each week in a live session. 

There will be two "cohorts" for these meetings. Half of the students will meet
live each week from **10:00 AM--10:55 AM on Mondays and Wednesdays**. The 
other half of the class will meet live each week 
**11:00 AM--11:55 AM on Mondays and Wednesdays**.


## Attendance and class participation

Because so much of the learning for this class is through interactive work in
class, it is critical that you join for the live meetings of our course. I will
take attendance for each of these live meetings.

On days that you have a quiz, the quiz will also be used to assess attendance. 
On other days, you will fill out an "Exit Ticket" when you leave the class. 

## Attendance and class participation

Lectures will be shared through YouTube. They are embedded in the online 
course book within each chapter. At the start of each chapter, you can also 
find a link to a YouTube playlist with all videos for the chapter.

knitr::include_graphics("../figures/playlist_2.png")
```

## Attendance and class participation

You will be responsible for watching 
certain videos *before* you attend each live session. You will receive
an email reminder with the list of videos you need to watch before each meeting.
There will be about two hours worth of video lectures each week, broken into 
videos about 10--15 minutes each.

This week, you will be responsible for watching the first nine videos
in Chapter 1 ("R Preliminaries"). 

## Attendance and class participation---ERHS 535

If you are in **ERHS 535**, out of a possible 10 points for class attendance,
you will get:

- **10 points** if you miss two or fewer classes
- **8 points** if you miss three classes
- **6 points** if you miss four classes
- **4 points** if you miss five classes
- **2 points** if you miss six classes
- **0 points** if you miss seven or more classes

## Attendance and class participation

Excused absences: 

- Attendance this week will not be counted
- CSU-related: This is typically missing to attend a conference or for a field
study for your research. To be excused, this requires a letter from your
adviser.
- Serious medical issue: To be excused, this requires a letter from a doctor or
other medical professional.
- For an absence to be excused, you must email me a copy of the letter by 5:00
pm the Friday afternoon following the class you missed.

## Weekly in-course group exercises

- As long as you attend the in-person session and participate in these exercises, you will get
full credit for this component.
- **If you miss a in-person meeting,** to get credit towards this component of your grade, you
will need to turn in a few paragraphs describing what was covered in the
exercise and what you learned.
- To get credit for this, you must submit it to me by email by 5:00 pm the Friday
afternoon after the class you missed.
- All in-class exercises are included in the online course book at the end of
the chapter on the associated material.

## Homework

- There will be six homework assignments (see detailed
schedule in the online course book).
- The first two should be done individually, the rest can be done in groups. 
- Homeworks will be graded for correctness, but some partial credit will be
given for questions you try but fail to answer correctly. Some of the exercises will 
not have "correct" answers, but instead will be graded on completeness.

## Homework 

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "300pt", echo = FALSE}
