# What is R?

## What is R?

- A programming language good for data analysis / statistics
- A base package of some software with many available user-created add-ons (packages)
- Free and open-source software
- An interpreted language

\bigskip

R is currently popular in a number of fields, including:

- Statistics / Biostatistics
- Machine learning
- Data journalism 
- Ecology 
- Financial engineering
- Bioinformatics

## What is R?

R is a programming language popular for statistical computing. \medskip

> "The best thing about R is that it was developed by statisticians. The worst thing about R is that... it was developed by statisticians."

> -Bo Cowgill, Google, at the Bay Area R Users Group

Other programming languages popular for statistical computing include: 

- SAS
- SPSS
- Matlab
- Julia
- Python

## Free and open-source software

How a lot of software is created:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/OpenSourceOverviewIntro.png")
```

## Free and open-source software

A basic sketch of how software can be "free":

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/OpenSourceOverview.png")
```

- **Gratis**: Free as in beer
- **Libre**: Free as in speech

## Free and open-source software

With open-source software (free as in speech), you can:

- Check out the code to figure out how the software works
- Share the code (and software) with other people
- Make any changes you want to the code

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/OpenSourceOverview.png")
```

<!-- ## Open-source software -->

<!-- > "Open-source software is simply software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. ... Open-source systems are tried and tested. A majority of supercomputers use them. The Defense Department, NASA and the United States Air Force all use open-source systems, because they know this provides far more security. Every step in our voting process should use software that follows these examples." -->

## Free and open-source software

> "Despite its name, open-source software is less vulnerable to hacking than the secret, black box systems like those being used in polling places now. That’s because anyone can see how open-source systems operate. Bugs can be spotted and remedied, deterring those who would attempt attacks. This makes them much more secure than closed-source models like Microsoft’s, which only Microsoft employees can get into to fix."

<!-- ## Open-source software -->

<!-- > "One reason for the software companies’ resistance is the belief that it’s impossible to make a profit from open-source software. This is a myth. Businesses that use open-source software still need all of the other things that software companies provide. Many major companies use open-source software in their products." -->

## Free and open-source software

Funding agencies are starting to ask for grant proposals to develop open-source tools. For example, a recent call from the NIH asks for: \medskip

> "**Open-source,** generalizable, and scalable bioinformatics tools"
