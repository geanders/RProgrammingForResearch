# RStudio vs. R

## RStudio vs. R

In this class, I'm having you download both R and RStudio. It's helpful for you 
to know the difference between the two. 

**R** provides the engine, while **RStudio** provides a nice place to work 
while using that engine (the leather interior, say). 

## RStudio vs. R

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "300pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/r_vs_rstudio.jpg")
```

## RStudio vs. R

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "200pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/plain_delorean.jpg")
```

**Note:** When you open **R**, it does have a user interface, it's just not 
as nice as RStudio's.

## RStudio vs. R

RStudio (the software) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You
download it separately from R, but it's a "nicer" way to work in R.

\bigskip

This IDE includes: 

- An interface with "panes" for key tasks you'll be doing (e.g., one pane with
the R console, one for scripts, one to view graphs)
- Code highlighting
- Version control (git) and interface with GitHub
- Tools for Shiny web app development
- Tools for R package development

## RStudio vs. R

RStudio (the company) is a leader in the R community. Currently, the company:

- Develops and freely provides the RStudio IDE
- Provides excellent resources for learning and using R (e.g., cheatsheets, free
online books)
- Is producing some of the most-used R packages 
- Employs some of the top people in R development
- Is a key member of The R Consortium (others include Microsoft, IBM, and Google)

## Setting up

If do not already have them, you will need to download and install both R and RStudio. 

- Go to https://cran.r-project.org and download the latest version of R for your system. Install.
- Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and download the latest version of RStudio Desktop for your system. Install. 
- Defaults should be fine for everything.
