- `arrange()`, including with `desc()`
- `%>%`, advantages of piping

- Common logical operators in R (`==`, `!=`, `%in%`, `is.na()`, `&`, `|`)


## Quiz 3 

- `data()` (with and without the name of a dataset as an option)
- `library()` (with and without an argument in the parentheses)

- What the bang operator (`!`) does to a logical operator
- `range()`

- `max()`
- `mean()`
- `median()`
- `table()`
- `cor()`, both for two variables in a dataframe, and to get the correlation matrix for several variables in a dataframe
- `summary()`, as applied to: different classes of vectors (numeric, factor, logical) and dataframes
- What to do if you want to apply a summary statistic function to a vector with missing values (you do not need to know every option name for all the functions, just know that you would need to include an option like `na.rm=` or `use=`, and that you can use the help file for a function to figure out the option call for that function).
- The following about object-oriented programming: In R, it means that some functions, like `summary()`, will do different things depending on what type of object you call it on.
- `summarize()`
- Special functions to use with `summarize()`: `n()`, `n_distinct()`, `first()`, `last()`
- Using `group_by()` before using `summarize()`

- `aes` function and common aesthetics, including `color`, `shape`, `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `size`, and `fill`
- Mapping an aesthetic to a column in the data versus setting it to a constant value
- Some common geoms: `geom_histogram`, `geom_points`, `geom_lines`, `geom_boxplot()`
- The difference between "statistical" geoms (e.g., `geom_boxplot`, `geom_smooth`) and "non-statistical" (e.g., `geom_point`, `geom_line`)
