## What is reproducible research?

A data analysis is **reproducible** if all the information (data, files, etc.) is available required for someone else re-do your entire analysis.

This includes: 

- Data available
- All code for cleaning raw data
- All code and software (specific versions, packages) for analysis

Some advantages of making your research reproducible are:

- You can (easily) figure out what you did six months from now.
- You can (easily) make adjustments to code or data, even early in the process, and re-run all analysis.
- When you're ready to publish, you can (easily) do a last double-check of your full analysis, from cleaning the raw data through generating figures and tables for the paper.
- You can pass along or share a project with others.
- You can give useful code examples to people who want to extend your research.

Here is a famous research example of the dangers of writing code that is hard to double-check or confirm:  

- [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/21528593)
- [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/health/research/08genes.html?_r=0)
- [Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/02/27/the-duke-saga-starter-set/)

Some of the steps required to making research reproducible are:

- All your raw data should be saved in the project directory. You should have clear documentation on the source of all this data.
- Scripts should be included with all the code used to clean this data into the data set(s) used for final analyses and to create any figures and tables.
- You should include details on the versions of any software used in analysis (for R, this includes the version of R as well as versions of all packages used). 
- If possible, there so be no "by hand" steps used in the analysis; instead, all steps should be done using code saved in scripts. For example, you should use a script to clean data, rather than cleaning it by hand in Excel. If any "non-scriptable" steps are unavoidable, you should very clearly document those steps. 

There are several software tools that can help you improve the reproducibility of your research: 

- **`knitr`**: Create files that include both your code and text. These can be compiled to create final reports and papers. They keep code within the final file for the report.
- **`knitr` complements**: Create fancier tables and figures within RMarkdown documents. Packages include `tikzDevice`, `animate`, `xtables`, and `pander`.
- **`packrat`**: Save versions of each package used for the analysis, then load those package versions when code is run again in the future.

In this section, I will focus on using `knitr` and RMarkdown files. 

## Markdown

R Markdown files are mostly written using Markdown. To write R Markdown files, you need to understand what markup languages like Markdown are and how they work. 

In Word and other word processing programs you have used, you can add formatting using buttons and keyboard shortcuts (e.g., "Ctrl-B" for bold). The file saves the words you type. It also saves the formatting, but you see the final output, rather than the formatting markup, when you edit the file (WYSIWYG-- what you see is what you get). 

In markup languages, on the other hand, you markup the document directly to show what formatting the final version should have (e.g., you type `**bold**` in the file to end up with a document with **bold**).

Examples of markup languages include:

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- LaTex
- Markdown (a "lightweight" markup language)

For example, Figure \@ref(fig:htmlexample) some marked-up HTML code from CSU's website, while Figure \@ref(fig:renderedexample) shows how that file looks when it's rendered by a web browser. 

```{r htmlexample, echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Example of the source of an HTLM file."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/example_html.png")
```

```{r renderedexample, echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Example of a rendered HTLM file."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/example_output.png")
```

To write a file in Markdown, you'll need to learn the conventions for creating formatting. This table shows what you would need to write in a flat file for some common formatting choices:

```{r echo = FALSE}
markdown_format <- data.frame(Code = c("`**text**`",
                                       "`*text*`",
                                       "`[text](www.google.com)`", 
                                       "`# text`", 
                                       "`## text`"),
                              Rendering = c("**text**",
                                            "*text*",
                                            "[text](www.google.com)",
                                            "",
                                            ""),
                              Explanation = c("boldface",
                                              "italicized",
                                              "hyperlink",
                                              "first-level header",
                                              "second-level header"))
knitr::kable(markdown_format)
```

Some other simple things you can do in Markdown include:

- Lists (ordered or bulleted)
- Equations
- Tables
- Figures from file
- Block quotes
- Superscripts

For more Markdown conventions, see [RStudio's R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) (link also available through "Help" in RStudio). 

## Literate programming in R

**Literate programming**, an idea developed by Donald Knuth, mixes code that can be executed with regular text. The files you create can then be rendered, to run any embedded code. The final output will have results from your code and the regular text. 

The `knitr` package can be used for literate programming in R. In essence, `knitr` allows you to write an R Markdown file that can be rendered into a pdf, Word, or HTML document.

Here are the basics of opening and rendering an R Markdown file in RStudio:

- To open a new R Markdown file, go to "File" -> "New File" -> "RMarkdown..." -> for now, chose a "Document" in "HTML" format.
- This will open a new R Markdown file in RStudio. The file extension for R Markdown files is ".Rmd". 
- The new file comes with some example code and text. You can run the file as-is to try out the example. You will ultimately delete this example code and text and replace it with your own.
- Once you "knit" the R Markdown file, R will render an HTML file with the output. This is automatically saved in the same directory where you saved your .Rmd file.
- Write everything besides R code using Markdown syntax.

To include R code in an RMarkdown document, you need to separate off the code chunk using the following syntax:

    `r ''````{r}
    my_vec <- 1:10
    ```
    
This syntax tells R how to find the start and end of pieces of R code when the file is rendered. R will walk through, find each piece of R code, run it and create output (printed output or figures, for example), and then pass the file along to another program to complete rendering (e.g., Tex for pdf files).


You can specify a name for each chunk, if you'd like, by including it after "r" when you begin your chunk. For example, to give the name `load_nepali` to a code chunk that loads the `nepali` dataset, specify that name in the start of the code chunk: \bigskip

    `r ''````{r load_nepali}
    library(faraway)
    data(nepali)
    ```

Here are a couple of tips for naming code chunks: 

- Chunk names must be unique across a document.
- Any chunks you don't name are given numbers by `knitr`.

You do not have to name each chunk. However, there are some advantages: 

- It will be easier to find any errors.  
- You can use the chunk labels in referencing for figure labels. 
- You can reference chunks later by name.

You can add options when you start a chunk. Many of these options can be set as TRUE / FALSE and include:

```{r echo = FALSE}
chunk_opts <- data.frame(Option = c("`echo`",
                                    "`eval`",
                                    "`messages`",
                                    "`warnings`",
                                    "`include`"),
                         Action = c("Print out the R code?",
                                    "Run the R code?",
                                    "Print out messages?",
                                    "Print out warnings?",
                                    "If FALSE, run code, but don't print code or results"))
knitr::kable(chunk_opts)
```

Other chunk options take values other than TRUE / FALSE. Some you might want to include are:

```{r echo = FALSE}
chunk_opts2 <- data.frame(Option = c("`results`",
                                     "`fig.width`",
                                     "`fig.height`"),
                          Action = c("How to print results (e.g., `hide` runs the code, but doesn't print the results)",
                                     "Width to print your figure, in inches (e.g., `fig.width = 4`)",
                                     "Height to print your figure"))
pander::pander(chunk_opts2, split.cells = c(10, 50),
               justify = c("center", "left"))
```

Add these options in the opening brackets and separate multiple ones with commas:

    `r ''````{r  messages = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    nepali[1, 1:3]
    ```

I will cover other chunk options later, once you've gotten the chance to try writting R Markdown files.

You can set "global" options at the beginning of the document. This will create new defaults for all of the chunks in the document. For example, if you want `echo`, `warning`, and `message` to be `FALSE` by default in all code chunks, you can run: 

    `r ''````{r  global_options}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE,
      warning = FALSE)
    ```

If you set both global and local chunk options that you set specifically for a chunk will take precedence over global options. For example, running a document with:

    `r ''````{r  global_options}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE,
      warning = FALSE)
    ```


    `r ''````{r  check_nepali, echo = TRUE}
    head(nepali, 1)
    ```
    
**would** print the code for the `check_nepali` chunk, because the option specified for that specific chunk (`echo = TRUE`) would override the global option (`echo = FALSE`).

You can also include R output directly in your text ("inline") using backticks: \bigskip

"There are `` `r '\x60r nrow(nepali)\x60'` `` observations in the `nepali` data set. The average age is `` `r '\x60r mean(nepali$age, na.rm = TRUE)\x60'` `` months."

\bigskip

Once the file is rendered, this gives: \bigskip

"There are `r nrow(nepali)` observations in the `nepali` data set. The average age is `r mean(nepali$age, na.rm = TRUE)` months."

\bigskip

Here are two tips that will help you diagnose some problems rendering R Markdown files:

- Be sure to save your R Markdown file before you run it.
- All the code in the file will run "from scratch"-- as if you just opened a new R session.
- The code will run using, as a working directory, the directory where you saved the R Markdown file.

You'll want to try out pieces of your code as you write an R Markdown document. There are a few ways you can do that:

- You can run code in chunks just like you can run code from a script (Ctrl-Return or the "Run" button). 
- You can run all the code in a chunk (or all the code in all chunks) using the different options under the "Run" button in RStudio. 
- All the "Run" options have keyboard shortcuts, so you can use those.

You can compile R Markdown documents to other formats:

- Word
- Pdf (requires that you've installed "Tex" on your computer.)
- Slides (ioslides)

Click the button to the right of "Knit" to see different options for rendering on your computer. 

You can freely post your RMarkdown documents at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com). If you want to post to RPubs, you need to create an account. Once you do, you can click the "Publish" button on the window that pops up with your compiled file. RPubs can also be a great place to look for interesting example code, although it sometimes can be pretty overwhelmed with MOOC homework. 

If you'd like to find out more, here are two good how-to books on reproducible research in R (the CSU library has both in hard copy):

- *Dynamic Documents with R and knitr*, Yihui Xie

## In-course exercise

For all of today's tasks, you'll use the code from last week's in-course exercise  to do the exercises. This week we are not focusing on writing new code, but rather on how to take R code and put it in an R Markdown file, so we can create reports from files that include the original code.

### Creating a Markdown document

First, you'll create a Markdown document, without any R code in it yet.

In RStudio, go to "File" -> "New File" -> "R Markdown". From the window that brings up, choose "Document" on the left-hand column and "HTML" as the output format. A new file will open in the script pane of your RStudio session. Save this file (you may pick the name and directory). The file extension should be ".Rmd".

First, before you try to write your own Markdown, try compiling the example that the script includes by default. (This code is always included, as a template, when you first open a new RMarkdown file using the RStudio "New file" interface we used in this example.) Try compiling this default R Markdown example by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of the script file. 

For some of you, you may not yet have everything you need on your computer to be able to get this to work. If so, let me know. RStudio usually includes all the necessary tools when you install it, but there may be some exceptions.

If you could get the document to knit, do the following tasks:

- Look through the HTML document that was created. Compare it to the R Markdown script that created it, and see if you can understand, at least broadly, what's going on.
- Look in the directory where you saved the R Markdown file. You should now also see a new, .html file in that folder. Try opening it with a web browser like Safari.
- Go back to the R Markdown file. Delete everything after the initial header information (everything after the 6th line). In the header information, make sure the title, author, and date are things you're happy with. If not, change them.
- Using Markdown syntax, write up a description of the data (`worldcup`) we used last week to create the fancier figure. Try to include the following elements:
    + Bold and italic text
    + Hyperlinks
    + A list, either ordered or bulleted
    + Headers
    
### Adding in R code

Now incorporate the R code from last week's exercise into your document. Once you get the document to render with some basic pieces of code in it, try the following:

- Try some different chunk options. For example, try setting `echo = FALSE` in some of your code chunks. Similarly, try using the options `results = "hide"` and `include = FALSE`. 
- You should have at least one code chunk that generates figures. Try experimenting with the `fig.width` and `fig.height` options for the chunk to change the size of the figure. 
- Try using the global commands. See if you can switch the `echo` default value for this document from TRUE (the usual default) to FALSE.

### Working with R Markdown documents

Finally, try the following tasks to get some experience working with R Markdown files in RStudio:

- Go to one of your code chunks. Locate the small gray arrow just to the left of the line where you initiate the code chunk. Click on it and see what happens. Then click on it again.
- Put your cursor inside one of your code chunks. Try using the "Run" button (or Ctrl-Return) to run code in that chunk at your R console. Did it work?
- Pick a code chunk in your document. Put your cursor somewhere in the code in that chunk. Click on the "Run" button and choose "Run All Chunks Above". What did that do? If it did not work, what do you think might be going on? (Hint: Check `getwd()` and think about which directory you've used to save your R Markdown file.)
- Pick another chunk of code. Put the cursor somewhere in the code for that chunk. Click on the "Run" button and choose "Run Current Chunk". Then try "Run Next Chunk". Try to figure out all the options the "Run" button gives you and when each might be useful.
- Click on the small gray arrow to the right of the "Knit HTML" button. If the option is offered, select "Knit Word" and try it. What does this do?

### R style guidelines

Go through all the R code in your R Markdown file. Are there are places where your code is not following style conventions for R? Clean up your code to correct any of these issues.
